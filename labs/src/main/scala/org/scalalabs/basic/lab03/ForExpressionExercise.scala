/** This exercise introduces you to Scala's for expression.
  *
  * For expressions are similar to for loops but are much more powerful.
  *
  * In this exercise we will solve problem number 4 of the Euler project
  * preferably using a for expression. In order to see how higher order
  * functions are related to a for expression you will also provide a solution
  * with higher order functions.
  *
  * The problem definition is as follows:
  *
  * A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
  * from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 x 99.
  *
  * Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
