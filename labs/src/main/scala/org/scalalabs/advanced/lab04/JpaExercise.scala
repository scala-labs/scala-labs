/**
 * The JPA exercises let experiment with Scala and JPA,
 * Java's official persistency framework. The exercises
 * are based on a JPA utility framework for Scala, which
 * is nothing more than a thin wrapper around JPA's EntityManager
 * with handy conversion methods for Scala.
 * For more information about the Scala JPA utility framework have
 * a look at: http://scala-tools.org/mvnsites-snapshots/scalajpa/
 * It's noteworthy to tell that this framework is used in lift in case
 * JPA is chosen as persistency technology.
 * This exercise contains two main sections. The first section
 * let you experiment directly with the ScalaEntityManger of Scala JPA.
 * In the second section you will implement DAOs (Data Access Object),
 * which delegate persistency operations to the Scala JPA utility API.

   * The Scaladocs of the Scala JPA API can be found here:
   * http://scala-tools.org/mvnsites/scalajpa/scaladocs/index.html
   * Detailed information about the API usage can be found here:

   * For these exercises you can use the Repository object, which gives
   * you direct access to the ScalaEntityManager
