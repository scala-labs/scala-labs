   * the required information (i.e. you don't have to instantiate it or take care this in any way yourself).
   *
   * The class below provied an example of a Type Safe Registry class. The idea is to be able to do the following:
   *
   * val reg = new TSReg[String, Int]
   * reg.add("a", 1)
   * reg.add("b", 2)
   *
   * safeGet[Int]("a") -> returns Some(1)
   * safeGet[Int]("c") -> returns None
   * safeGet[String]("a") -> returns None
   *
   * so the given type passed to the safeGet method should match the return type of this registry.
