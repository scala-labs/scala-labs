 * A not so useful, but fun if you like it, exercise in encoding Church natural numbers using Scala types.
 * This is implemented using type aliases. The idea is that a trait can define an abstract type alias,
 * that can than be refined in subtraits or classes. In this way, one can define type-safe systems.

  /**
   * Trait representing a Church Boolean data type.
   * @see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding
   *
   * It is possible to define a type to be defined within classes or traits.
   * These types can then be made concrete in a subclass.
   * Not that the type keyword just defines a type alias, which can be used as follows:
   *
   * <code>
   * scala> type stringList = List[String]
   * defined type alias stringList
   *
   * scala> val l: stringList = List()
   * l: stringList = List()
   *
   * scala> val l: stringList = List("a")
   * l: stringList = List(a)
   *
   * scala> val l: stringList = List(1)
   * <console>:6: error: type mismatch;
   * found   : Int(1)
   * required: String
   *      val l: stringList = List(1)
   * </code>
   *
   *
   * The trait CBool has an abstract type named cond, which has type parameters T and F (which stands for true and false, obviously).
   * The idea is to refine these types in the subclasses CFalse and CTrue, so that:
   *
   * <code>val ctrue: CTrue#cond[Int, String] = 10</code>
   * and
   * <code>val cfalse: CFalse#cond[Int, String] = "abcd"</code>
   *
   * both would compile, but
   *
   * <code>val ctrue: CTrue#cond[Int, String] = "abcd"</code>
   *
   * and
   *
   * <code>val cfalse: CFalse#cond[Int, String] = 10</code>
   *
   * would not.
   *
   * Note: The type defined by this trait can be accessed by the following (for example):
   *
   * val bool = CBool#cond[String, Int]
   *
   *
