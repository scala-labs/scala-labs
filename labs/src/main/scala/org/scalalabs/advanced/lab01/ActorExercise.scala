 * Scala's actors are units of execution that process messages.
 * Messages can be send to an Actor using the ! method. They are then stored in the Actor's mailbox.
 * If an Actor does not have any messages in it's mailbox to process, it is suspended.
 * Messages are processed asynchronously and  Actor's process only one message at a time.
 * Because the actor's state can only be modified by sending a message, and messages are processed serially
 * they are thread-safe by default.
 * It is therefore an interesting alternative to the normal concurrency model of taking locks.
