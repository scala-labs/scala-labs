/** In this Lab you will implement a ScalaTest testcase.
  *
  * Instructions:
  * 1. Implement the divide method in Euro that has the following signature:  def /(divider:Int) = ???
  * - If the divider is <=0 throw an IllegalArgumentException
  *
  * 2. Write a ScalaTest using a Spec of your choice to test:
  * - Happy flow (divider is > 0)
  * - Alternative flow (divider is <= 0)
