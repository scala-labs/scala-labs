This is the top level project for the Scala ITR. It will contain all the exercises and the test suite.

**How to run test**
Tests can be run from within labs directory like this:
    sbt "testOnly org.scalalabs.basic.lab01.HelloWorldExerciseTest"

**Note**: We recommend to use sbt interactively instead of starting sbt each time you want to run a test. See [Running the sbt shell](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Running.html)
