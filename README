This is the top level project for the Scala ITR. It will contain all the exercises and the test suite.
---
This fork has a few minor changes that would've made my life easier at the time I ran through the labs
- Formatted typesafe's sbt-scalariform plugin
- Fixed a few typos
- Fixed tests that were failing or not running when they should have been passing
- Broke up and reordered exercises in advanced/lab03, added reference for the "Mammals" problem
